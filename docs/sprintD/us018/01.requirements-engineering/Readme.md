# US 018 - Store Manager analyse the deals .

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As a store manager, I intend to analyse the deals (only sale of houses and apartments) made. In particular, I intend to compare property sale values with the forecast values

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

Each store in the network has a store manager and the set of stores is managed by a store network  manager. The main functions of a store manager are to monitor and streamline the branch with the  aim of getting to know better the business carried out and to analyse and evaluate the performance of employees.


**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** When the store manager selects simple-linear regression to analyse the deals, does he also select one of the specified relevant parameters to serve as the [in]dependent variable in the regression model? ("property area in square feet, the distance from the center, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathroomsand the number of parking spaces").
>
> **Answer:** The store manager should choose the independent variable and the regression model to be used to fit the data. Important: The property area is always in square feet. There is no need to convert the values loaded from the file.

> **Question:** In US018 it is stated that its purpose is to analyse deals made in order to "compare property sale values with the forecast values". However I don't understand what exactly does the user input. Does the user select a property and receives it's predicted value? Does he select a deal and compares the sale price with the predicted price? Or does he not input anything (other than the desired regression model) and just gets the regression model as output? If so, does he receive the regression model as a graph or just as an equation?
>
> **Answer:** Please discuss this question with MATCP teachers. Moreover, please read carefully the AC3 of US18.  In a previous answer I also said: "n USs 17, 18 and 19, the network manager and the store manager should be able to explore/analyze ALL deals that are registered in the system. To develop the work required by MATCP and MDISC courses, you should have a clean/empty system and you should load the CSV file that is already available in moodle (please the link "CSV file generated by the legacy system to be explored in US17, US18 and US19" available in moodle)."

> **Question:** A report containing regression methods, confidence intervals, and other US-related aspects of MATCP is mentioned in the Sprint D requirements document for US018. The team is wondering if this "report" refers to information that should be displayed in the application itself, the user manual, or both. And if the "report" isn't going to be displayed in the app, are we only going to show the user the forecasted price in relation to the chosen property and the regression model with all the necessary statistics?
>
> **Answer:** In US18 the application should show, to the store manager, the forecasts, the regression model, statistics, etc.. The teams should use this output of the application to write the report (annexes of the user manual).

> **Question:** When the store manager analyses the property values, can he analyse one property, all the properties, or a selection of properties of their choosing?
>
> **Answer:** The system should present the price estimates (using the selected regression model) for all house and apartment deals made.

> **Question:** When it comes to analysing the properties can the store manager see all the properties in the system?
>
> **Answer:** The goal of this US is to compare property (only house and apartment properties) sale values with the forecast values. Therefore, the system should only show all house and apartments deals made, including deals that were imported from the leagacy system.


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** The goal of this US is to forecast property sale prices (only for houses and apartments) using information from the property area (in square feet), the distance from the center (in miles), the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms and the number of parking spaces features of each property. 
* **AC2:** The system should accept CSV files..
* **AC3:** All houses and apartments business registered in the system should be used to fit the regression models..
* **AC4:** The request must be valid and registered in the system.
* **AC5:** A Store is registered employee by the Systems Administrator..
* **AC6:** The system should enable the actor to select each regression model and should present the price estimates using the selected model. Moreover, the system should show the selected regression model and all required statistics.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* There is a dependency to US03: "As a system administrator, I want to register a new employee. " since the Agent has to be a registered employee by the Systems Administrator.
* There is a dependency to US07: "Register in the system " The Client must be a registered user.
* There is a dependency to US11: "Display Listed Purchase Order and respond" use list of properties with the deal already successfull.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data
